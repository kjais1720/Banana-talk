# Banana-talk
A Fun minion translator.
- It takes one input(text to be translated).
- It translates the text into minion language using 'Fun translations API'.
- It's a free API version so it can only send a few requests per hour. So if you're not getting a result right now. Try it again after some time.
- In order to practice the use of API even more, I also used Responsive voice API. So, an automated voice speaks the translated text when the output is displayed.
- This is the mark6 project of Neog Camp level 0 portfolio
